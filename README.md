A base to make injectable cheats for minecraft using java native interface.

Currently in developpement.
Uses weird jni export function hooking to make the cheat more undetectable. That's why there is a weird init/exit system
For now support only lunarclient 1.8.9

Included Example Features :
- AimAssist

A base to make injectable cheats for minecraft using java native interface.

Currently in developpement.
Uses weird jni export function hooking for better compatibility with clients that doesn't allow the creation of new JNIEnv*. That's why there is a weird init/exit system, I might change this weird code in the future

Included Example Features :
- AimAssist
